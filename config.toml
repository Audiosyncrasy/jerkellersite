I was absolutely blown away at at the life that Jerâ€™s drumming added to my songs. His preparation and execution to deliver a quality product was nothing short of world class. Jer is professional and intentional in his approach, masterful with his technique, and his humble personality flows through his drum grooves as he seeks to serve the music in the best possible way."

Not only is he fluent in his work on the drums, his ear is finely tuned having spent much of his time behind a mixing console working on projects ranging from death metal to mainstream rock, its a guarantee you wont be dissapointed."
