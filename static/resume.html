<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>In my work and personal life, I gravitate toward opportunities to pair creativity with a technical challenge. In the past few years, I have developed a passion for programming. Learning the craft of programming has re-ignited my joy for learning and a desire to take my skills to the next level in a fast-paced, creative environment.</p>
<h1 id="career-history">Career History</h1>
<h2 id="freelance-web-designer-and-developer">Freelance Web Designer and Developer</h2>
<h3 id="self-employed-2017---2018">Self-employed (2017 - 2018)</h3>
<p>Early in my coding journey, I discovered that several of my friends and family needed websites for their small businesses. I saw this as a great opportunity to earn some cash, clout, and experience programming in a real-world situation. Each client project was completed on time and within budget.</p>
<p>Completed client projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://genofevephotography.com">Gen of Eve Photography<br>
</a> I worked with Genevieve, a freelance photographer, to build a custom WordPress site to showcase her photography work and to help her develop a web-presence through regular blog posts. Site features include a robust photo gallery, a blog page, and an interface that allows her to refresh content on her website as her business grows and changes.</li>
<li><a href="https://toddsautoservice.com">Todd’s Auto Service<br>
</a> As the owner and sole employee of a Honda maintenance shop, Todd wanted a simple, fast-loading web site that requires little maintenance, provided contact information for his shop, and provided descriptions of the services he offers. The responsive design includes a Testimonials section that contains Facebook reviews and an interactive map on the Contact page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personal portfolio site:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jerkeller.com">JerKeller.com<br>
</a> I needed a place to exhibit the projects I’ve been working on for the past several months and show my progress as a developer. I used this process as an opportunity to learn about static site generators, proper Git versioning, and advanced publishing techniques. The code for the site is housed in a <a href="https://github.com/Audiosyncrasy/jerkellersite">public GitHub repository</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="aso-correspondence-intake-and-appeals-regence-blueshield-burlington-wa">ASO Correspondence, Intake, and Appeals, Regence BlueShield, Burlington, WA</h2>
<h3 id="lead-ambassador-2007---2018">Lead Ambassador (2007 - 2018)</h3>
<p>I am currently a Lead on our Correspondence team, which involves supporting front-line employees with analyzing complex clinical information and synthesizing external communications for multiple audiences inside deadlines of 48-hours or less.</p>
<p>In addition, I’m responsible for creating and maintaining technical instructions for my team’s processes.</p>
<p>While working at Regence BlueShield, I have found myself gravitating toward projects that allow me to engage my technical knowledge and creativity. I spent several years managing the department letter writing system, including programming letter logic and working with leadership to develop more efficient processes. After analyzing the overall effectiveness of our outreach efforts, I automated more than a dozen manual processes and increased efficiency by reducing our letter inventory by 21 percent.</p>
<p>During my time on the front-lines of the Correspondence Team, I was able to work on several notable projects. I designed and published our team’s first Excel-based reporting solution which allowed department leaders to track our timeliness as we moved from a 46 percent to a 95 percent accuracy rate over 2 years.</p>
<p>I also participated in a collaborative, cross-functional team project to develop a spreadsheet tool to replace our paper-and-ink aging report system. The project saved the company thousands of dollars in paper and ink, and I received a bonus for my efforts.</p>

<h3 id="massive-open-online-course-focused-on-javascript-technologies">Massive Open Online Course focused on JavaScript technologies</h3>
<p>After working in the medical insurance industry for over ten years, I made the decision to learn how to program. I spent some time researching which language to learn, and I finally settled on JavaScript. With a wife, three children, and a full-time job, an on-site coding bootcamp or university program was not a financially feasible option. The free curriculum offered by <a href="http://freeCodeCamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a> provides the structured program I need to stay focused on building my skills.</p>
<p>Certifications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/audiosyncrasy/responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/audiosyncrasy/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Completed projects:</p>

<h3 id="projects-i-have-completed-to-further-my-knowledge-of-javascript">Projects I have completed to further my knowledge of JavaScript</h3>
<p>Completed projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://codepen.io/Audiosyncrasy/full/dmGXdW/">Random Number Generator<br>
</a>I built this app to solve a need I had at my current job. In order to perform audits for my team, I need a random sample of work. Manual efforts to choose random documents are not truly random. This app allows me to generate a random number within a user-entered starting and ending number. This project also allowed me to study the global Math object and some of its methods.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="university-of-washington-seattle-wa">University of Washington, Seattle, WA</h2>
<h3 id="b.a.-communication-2006">B.A. Communication, 2006</h3>
<p>In addition to my general coursework, I also immersed myself in guided research for a tenured professor, taking an in-depth look at historic theaters in the Pacific Northwest. I enrolled in a course load oriented toward experimental physics to satisfy my love for science.</p>
<h1 id="other-interests">Other Interests</h1>
<p>I play drums for several local bands and also provide audio engineering and production services.</p>
